# Documentation: Data Science Capstone: Predictive Text Model

## Overview

The goal of this Shiny app is to create a data product to highlight the prediction algorithm that I have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. This Shiny app accepts an n-gram phrase entered by the user and predicts the next word.

## Main Panel

1. **Phrase:** Enter English text in the textbox provided.

2. Click on the **Predict** button to predict the next word for the phrase entered in the textbox.

3. **Results:** This is where the six predicted words will be shown for the phrase entered in the textbox.
